        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a junior at Texas A&M University. 
        I was born in Houston, Texas but I currently live in San Antonio, 
        Texas. I worked in the web development team at Texas A&M University 
        since March 2022. My hobbies include watching anime, Netflix 
        and crocheting. My favorite animes include Fullmetal Alchemist and 
        Banana Fish. I have a dog named Rylo who I've had for 7 years. This 
        summer I am working on my first internship as a STEP Intern with 
        CodePath and Workday. </p>
